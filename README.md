# Roomba Virtual Wall

## Description

This is an old project that I've been using for a couple of years. Sorry for not having all the references I originally used, I'll try to update as soon as possible.

Many of this things are pretty rough, specially the 3D printed enclosure as it was my first model. Hope this can help anyone interested.

## TODO

- Correct PCB wiring for LED Pin - checar en el prototipo 2
- Eliminar el algoritmo del led para indicar nivel de batería - no funciona bien
- Generar nueva version (v3)
- Documento de descripción del proyecto
- Fotos / Video
