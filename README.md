# Roomba-like Virtual Wall

## Description

This is an old project that I've been using at home for a couple of years. Sorry for not having all the references I originally used to develop this, I'll try to update as soon as possible.

Many of this things are pretty rough, specially the PCB and the 3D printed enclosure as it was my first model. Hope this can help anyone interested.

- Arduino based code for ATTiny85 controller, a IR Led and a standard white led for status
- Used a MT3608 voltage booster and 2 or 3 AA/AAA batteries
- PCB dessigned with Freecad, DIYed at home (2.5x5cm copper PBC)
- Programmed the uC with Arduino (1.8+) IDE. Download libraries for ATT85. Use Arduino UNO as ISP to program. Check references in code
- Enclosure designed in Blender and 3D printed on a Monoprice Select Mini v2 with black PLA

## TODO:

- Correct PCB wiring for LED Pin - checar en el prototipo 2
- Eliminar el algoritmo del led para indicar nivel de batería - no funciona bien
- Generar nueva version (v3)
- Documento de descripción del proyecto, referencias a proyectos originales
- Fotos / Video
