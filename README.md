# Roomba Virtual Wall

This is an old project that I've been using for a couple of years. Sorry for not having all the references I originally used, I'll try to update as soon as possible.

Many of this things are pretty rough, specially the 3D printed enclosure as it was my first model. Hope this can help anyone interested.
